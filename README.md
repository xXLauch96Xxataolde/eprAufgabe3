What my great code misses:
- roll_cheating_dice
ok complete game loop, to only exit with exit method
- whats with the 3 seconds thing
- what about test cases
- overhauled menue
- maybe patch the prints and outputs, to funny???
- the coder needs some sleep
- in configure your game thing: ask if seed is wanted
- place docstrings and comments everywhere in the code
- write the help method, maybe per input txt
- work on the header
- optimate dice = 9. fuck
- force dice_roll after 3 seconds
