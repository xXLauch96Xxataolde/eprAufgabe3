What my great code misses:
- style and more animations
- roll_cheating_dice
- complete game loop, to only exit with exit method
- whats with the 3 seconds thing
- what about test cases
- overhauled menue
- maybe patch the prints and outputs, to funny???
- the coder needs some sleep
- in configure your game thing: ask if seed is wanted
- place docstrings and comments everywhere in the code
- write the help method, maybe per input txt
